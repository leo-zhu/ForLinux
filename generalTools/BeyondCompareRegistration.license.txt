You shouldn't try to type your license key manually.  Follow these  
steps to enter the key: 
 
1) If you haven't already, download and install Beyond Compare 4 from: 
    http://www.scootersoftware.com/download.php 
 
2) Highlight the above key and press Ctrl+C to copy it to the  
clipboard.  It's okay if you include some of the message before and  
after the key, but be sure to include the BEGIN and END lines and  
everything in between. 
 
3) Then, run Beyond Compare and select "Enter Key" (from the Help menu  
or any of the "Evaluation" dialog boxes).  Beyond Compare should  
automatically detect your key on the Clipboard -- Just click "OK" to  
accept it. 
 
4) Exit and restart Beyond Compare if it asks you to do so.  From the  
Help menu, select "About Beyond Compare" to verify your license  
information.
